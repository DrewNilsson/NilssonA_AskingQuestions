He used the .length to make sure the input wasn't more than the wanted time format, and for each string he targeted the exact portions wanted by using substring. He used bools and ints to make sure the inputs were what was needed for the format ie. the hours at substring (0,2) to parse it to see if it was a number to use. The only feedback is that if I put something higher than 24 (the hours in a day) lke 48, it lets it go through. Other than that stellar program frfr.
